# TicketHub 

TicketHub is a ticket management system application for project developers. It is pet project I took on to gain a hands-on understanding of automated testing when building out web applications. I built TicketHub in an Agile-like fashion, developing on feature at a time, then refining each feature until it functioned seamlessly within the application before moving on to the next. In addition to taking a practical approach to learning the various facets of TDD and BDD, I also exercised a number of advanced features of Rails.  


The TicketHub application boasts:
* **RESTful routing and validations** 
* **CRUD interface for projects, tickets, users, and admin users ** 
* **Sign Up/Sign In functionality** 
* **Basic authentication system** 
* **Fine grain access control** 

TicketHub was developed using the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework and testing tools including RSpec, FactoryGirl and Capybara.

Thanks for checking out my work!
